If you don't know how to gain that, please <a href=\"https://kb.nologs-vpn.com/how-to-access-the-console-of-your-vm/\">follow our guide</a>.</p>\n<h3>Generate Wireguard client keys</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://kb.nologs-vpn.com/how-to-access-the-console-of-your-vm/\"></a>After logging in the ssh console you need to create the keys for the new user. Wireguard uses these keys to keep track of peers and authenticate them:</p>\n<pre>docker run --rm cmulk/wireguard-docker:buster genkeys</pre>\n<p>This will print 2 keys: a public and a private one:</p>\n<pre>-e Private Key: 8JlkyYRuR/OdFlBOUDVfM+DknvUUsjtnduNoEeqsLWA=<br>-e Public Key: KglpBFVBdJhCIkrs8ZK/EZhkSkslz873CroBAEsg/2I=</pre>\n<p>You have to copy both of them so we can go ahead with our next step (ommit the <code>-e Private Key</code> and <code>-e Public Key</code> bits).</p>\n<h3>Configure the server and add the new user</h3>\n<p>Now that we have our keys it is time to edit the main configuration file for Wireguardby running:</p>\n<pre>nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf</pre>\n<p>nano is a console editor and it will let you modify the file which looks something like this when being edited:</p>\n<pre>[Interface]<br>Address = 192.168.20.1/24<br>SaveConfig = true<br>PostUp = iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE<br>PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE<br>ListenPort = 5555<br>PrivateKey = 6IrKiXy2jdMxu9MQwh5Tl+EqxltMWPQvPv9at5YOrlQ=<br><br>[Peer]<br>PublicKey = hgx2jsPIsp6E2cltv1BIgf+YHQVBuazsvt6XuceHTXk=<br>AllowedIPs = 192.168.20.2/32</pre>\n<p>We can see there are 2 sections here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Interface</li>\n<li>Peer</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Interface part is about the server and the Peer is actually the first client that is allowed to connect. You can see that the first peer has a <code>PublicKey</code> (like the one you just generated) and an <code>AllowedIPs</code> param. We will need to replicate that and create a new <code>Peer</code> so the new config will look like this:</p>\n<pre>[Interface]<br>Address = 192.168.20.1/24<br>SaveConfig = true<br>PostUp = iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE<br>PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE<br>ListenPort = 5555<br>PrivateKey = 6IrKiXy2jdMxu9MQwh5Tl+EqxltMWPQvPv9at5YOrlQ=<br><br>[Peer]<br>PublicKey = hgx2jsPIsp6E2cltv1BIgf+YHQVBuazsvt6XuceHTXk=<br>AllowedIPs = 192.168.20.2/32<br><br>[Peer]<br>PublicKey = KglpBFVBdJhCIkrs8ZK/EZhkSkslz873CroBAEsg/2I=<br>AllowedIPs = 192.168.20.3/32</pre>\n<p>Look carefully and take note that I added a new <code>Peer</code> with the public key we just generated above and I also incremented the <code>AllowedIPs</code> from <code>192.168.20.2/32</code> to <code>192.168.20.3/32</code> to avoid any IP space collisions.</p>\n<p>You can save the file by pressing <code>CTRL+X</code> and writing the letter <code>y</code> once prompted to save the changes.</p>\n<p>Following this change you need to restart the Wireguard instance:</p>\n<pre>docker restart $(docker ps -aq)</pre>\n<h3>Create the client config file</h3>\n<p>There's one more step and that is to create the new client config that the new member should use to connect. For this let's create a copy of the original client.config file and edit the Interface part. The Peer, in this case, is the server so that section needs to stay the same:</p>\n<pre class=\"aLF-aPX-K0-aPE\">[Interface]\nAddress = 192.168.20.3/24\nPrivateKey = 8JlkyYRuR/OdFlBOUDVfM+DknvUUsjtnduNoEeqsLWA=\nListenPort = 0 \n\n[Peer]\nPublicKey = g4gaGC/F2Fz3E2cH7Ek1ZQTRTEHosZQ4oEOzpf6e/y0=\nEndpoint = 165.227.147.194:58281\nAllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0,::/0 #makes sure ALL traffic routed through VPN\nPersistentKeepalive = 25</pre>\n<p>What I edited here is the Interface <code>Address</code> to the one we allocated to our new user (<code>192.168.20.3</code>) and the <code>PrivateKey</code> which I updated with the private key that we generated above: <code>8JlkyYRuR/OdFlBOUDVfM+DknvUUsjtnduNoEeqsLWA=</code> . Other than that pretty much remained the same.</p>\n<p>That's it! I know it is a bit difficult and we're working on automating this process in the future.</p>",

One thing that I recommend before any major operation such as this one is to take a snapshot of your server. Keep in mind that, during the creation of the snapshot, your VM instance will be powered down.<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://kb.nologs-vpn.com/media/posts/2/snapshot-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px\" srcset=\"https://kb.nologs-vpn.com/media/posts/2/responsive/snapshot-2-xs.png 300w ,https://kb.nologs-vpn.com/media/posts/2/responsive/snapshot-2-sm.png 480w ,https://kb.nologs-vpn.com/media/posts/2/responsive/snapshot-2-md.png 749w\"  height=\"806\" width=\"1128\" alt=\"\" />\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    This operation will allow us to revert back to a working state in case something unplanned takes place.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Now that our server has a snapshot we can go ahead with the upgrade process so let's navigate to the \"Resize\" page.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://kb.nologs-vpn.com/media/posts/2/resize-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px\" srcset=\"https://kb.nologs-vpn.com/media/posts/2/responsive/resize-2-xs.png 300w ,https://kb.nologs-vpn.com/media/posts/2/responsive/resize-2-sm.png 480w ,https://kb.nologs-vpn.com/media/posts/2/responsive/resize-2-md.png 749w\"  height=\"1147\" width=\"1104\" alt=\"\" />\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    Usually, a VPN server is heavier on the CPU&nbsp; than anything else so I recommend looking at upgrades in terms of CPU more than anything else.
